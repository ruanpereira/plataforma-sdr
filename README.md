For scripts, usage, extras, docs, etc.

To use it, first we need to add the sources of the ubuntu 20.04 to the new 22.04: 

''' sudo sh plataforma-sdr/adding20.04-sources.sh '''



After that, while you are on the home dir, install first srsRAN4G:

''' sh plataforma-sdr/installing-srsran4g.sh'''

Pay attention to be sure that the installing is running smoothly.
